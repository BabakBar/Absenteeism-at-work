# Absenteeism-at-work
Exploratory Analysis using graphs, clustering &amp; K-mean by R Programming

 Employees with low performance cause a vital lose for organizations and the absenteeism consider to be one of the factors that affect performance.
Absenteeism is defined as absence to work as expected, represents for the company the loss of productivity and quality of work. In this context, the prediction of absenteeism becomes important in decision making avoiding loss of efficiency and excellence at work.

 The aim of this project is to discover the factors and causes of employees absence using exploratory data analysis. 
In this methodology, the work starts with data cleaning and preprocessing the absenteeism database by grouping some type of attributes and studying the correlation between the attributes and the absenteeism to find the significant causes of absenteeism. 

 After the analysis we concluded our exploratory data analysis using graphs and clustering analysis. In this report the analysis approach was hierarchical clustering using the *euclidean* method and the complete linkage. In this clustering, we were able to see more clear what physical profiles and age groups were contributing to employee absenteeism. This method can be taken into account for different grouping and further analysis.
